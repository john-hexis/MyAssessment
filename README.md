# MyAssessment

This iOS application is used to show a mobile usage list from an API.

Purpose of this app is to demonstrate the use of VIPER design pattern and REPOSITORY design pattern on iOS development.

VIPER design pattern is implemented based on my knowledge, skills and working experience. It's pure on my thought, it can be wrong it can be correct based on how developer perspective.

REPOSITORY design pattern is implemented based on Google show case on android ROOM data base implementation but here, I already markup with some generic class to make REPOSITORY design pattern more dynamically suitable to support many shape of model

# Test

This application is also provided with Unit test show case and UI test show case.

For UNIT TEST, I demonstrate to test on repository layer, local data source and API datasource layer. With this small scope of application, I only provided few test cases of unit test for each layers

On UI Test, I provided with couple test case to demonstrate user expectation while open this application for the first time.

ADIOS - please leave comments on my shared project
